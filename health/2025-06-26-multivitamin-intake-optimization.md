## What I optimized
I changed my multivitamin consumption pattern from taking 2 pills in the morning to taking 1 pill in the morning and 1 pill in the evening.

## How I did it
I previously had a habit of taking my daily recommended 2 multivitamin pills together in the morning. After researching the benefits of splitting vitamin intake, I decided to change my routine:
1. Set up morning and evening pill containers
2. Created reminders on my phone for both morning and evening doses
3. Started taking 1 pill with breakfast and 1 pill with dinner

## Impact
Splitting the multivitamin intake into two separate doses provides several benefits:

1. **Improved absorption efficiency**: Many vitamins are better absorbed in smaller doses. When taking a large dose at once, the body may not be able to absorb all nutrients efficiently, and excess water-soluble vitamins (like B and C) are simply excreted.

2. **Maintained blood levels**: Water-soluble vitamins don't stay in the body for long periods. By spacing out intake, I maintain more consistent vitamin levels throughout the day.

3. **Reduced gastrointestinal discomfort**: High doses of certain vitamins and minerals can cause stomach upset. Splitting the dose reduces the concentration at any one time, potentially decreasing digestive discomfort.

4. **Better utilization of fat-soluble vitamins**: Some vitamins (A, D, E, K) are better absorbed with dietary fat. By taking one dose with breakfast and one with dinner, I ensure proper absorption with meals containing fat.

5. **Decreased competition between minerals**: Some minerals compete for absorption (like zinc, iron, and calcium). Separating doses can reduce this competition.

## Lessons learned
- Timing of supplement intake can be as important as the supplements themselves
- The body processes nutrients more efficiently in smaller, distributed doses
- Small changes to daily routines can have meaningful health impacts
- It's worth researching optimal consumption patterns for any supplements
