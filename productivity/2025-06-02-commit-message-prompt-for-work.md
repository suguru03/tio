## What I optimized
Instead of spending time crafting commit messages from scratch each time, I created a structured prompt template that generates consistent, professional commit messages following conventional commit format. This streamlines my git workflow and saves valuable development time.

## How I did it
- Analyzed common commit patterns and conventional commit standards
- Created a prompt template with predefined types (feat, fix, docs, etc.) and scopes
- Included practical examples for different scenarios (new features, bug fixes, documentation)
- Added guidelines for writing clear, concise commit messages
- Structured the output to be ready-to-use with git commands
- Made it specific to project needs while maintaining industry standards

## Impact
- Reduces time spent thinking about commit message structure
- Ensures consistency across all commits in projects
- Improves git history readability for team collaboration
- Eliminates decision fatigue around commit message formatting
- Creates a reusable workflow that can be applied to any project
- Enhances professional development practices

## Lessons learned
- Standardizing repetitive tasks through templates significantly improves efficiency
- Well-structured commit messages are crucial for project maintenance and collaboration
- Investing time in creating workflow tools pays dividends in daily productivity
- Automation of routine decisions frees mental energy for more complex tasks
