## What I optimized
Since Copilot's GitHub MCP functionality was unavailable, I set up the `gh` CLI to leverage GitHub Prompt for similar capabilities.

## How I did it
1. Installed the `gh` CLI tool.
2. Configured GitHub Prompt to work seamlessly with the `gh` CLI.
3. Tested the setup to ensure it could replicate MCP-like functionality.

## Impact
- Enabled efficient use of GitHub Prompt for tasks previously dependent on MCP.
- Improved workflow by providing a reliable alternative.

## Lessons learned
- The `gh` CLI is a powerful tool for automating GitHub-related tasks.
- Proper configuration can bridge gaps when certain features are unavailable.
