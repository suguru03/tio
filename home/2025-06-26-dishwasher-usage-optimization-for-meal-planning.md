## What I optimized
I improved the rule for running the dishwasher to prevent dishes from piling up after meals.

## How I did it
Changed the dishwasher operation rule from "run when full" to a more proactive approach:

1. **Assess future needs** - After each meal, evaluate if there will be enough space for the next meal's dishes
2. **Run preemptively** - If the dishwasher won't have enough capacity for the next meal's dishes, run it even if it's not completely full
3. **Empty promptly** - Empty the dishwasher as soon as the cycle completes to maintain maximum available capacity

**Key principle:** Prioritize having available capacity for upcoming meals rather than maximizing load efficiency.

## Impact
- **Eliminated dish pile-ups** - No more dishes left out because the dishwasher is full
- **Reduced kitchen clutter** - Counter space remains clear and organized
- **Improved kitchen hygiene** - Fewer dishes sitting out collecting dust or attracting pests
- **Reduced stress** - No more frustration when finding no space for dishes after a meal

## Lessons learned
- Sometimes efficiency (running full loads) needs to be balanced with practicality (having space when needed)
- Anticipating future needs is more effective than reacting to current situations
- Small changes in household rules can have significant quality-of-life improvements
- The best system is one that prevents problems rather than solving them after they occur
