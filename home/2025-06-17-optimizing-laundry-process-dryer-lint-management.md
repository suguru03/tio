## What I optimized
I developed a systematic laundry process that prevents lint from spreading and follows a "clean-to-dirty" workflow when handling laundry items with a stacked washer-dryer setup.

## How I did it
Created a 4-step process that prioritizes cleanliness and lint management:

1. **Remove items from dryer first** (if any) - Handle the cleanest items when hands are cleanest
2. **Replace used towels with fresh ones** - Ensure clean towels are available for the process
3. **Start washing machine and add detergent/softener, close lid** - Begin the washing cycle
4. **Clean dryer lint with vacuum cleaner** - Remove accumulated lint to prevent contamination

**Key principle:** Always handle the cleanest items first, progressing to dirtier tasks to avoid cross-contamination.

## Impact
- **Prevents lint spread:** Systematic approach keeps lint contained and prevents it from getting on clean clothes
- **Maintains hygiene:** Clean-to-dirty workflow ensures optimal cleanliness throughout the process
- **Reduces mess:** Proper sequencing minimizes the need to re-clean items
- **Streamlined workflow:** Consistent process reduces decision fatigue and makes laundry more efficient

## Lessons learned
- The order of operations matters significantly in household tasks
- Starting with the cleanest items and progressing to dirtier tasks is a universal principle that can apply to many cleaning processes
- **Area for improvement:** The vacuum cleaner gets very dusty during lint removal, suggesting there might be a better method to capture lint without creating additional mess
- Simple procedural changes can have a meaningful impact on both efficiency and results
