# TIO

TIO (Today I Optimized) is a repository for documenting how I improved small things in my life and work.

## 📝 What is TIO?

Every day presents opportunities for small improvements. This repository captures those moments when I optimize something - whether it's a workflow, a habit, a tool, or just a better way of thinking about a problem. Each entry documents what was improved, how it was done, and the impact it had.

## 📂 Categories

- **🚀 [productivity](./productivity/README.md)** - workflow, time management, tools
- **💪 health** - exercise, diet, sleep, wellness  
- **💻 technology** - coding, software, hardware optimizations
- **💬 communication** - meetings, emails, documentation
- **📚 learning** - study methods, skill development
- **💰 finance** - budgeting, investing, expense tracking
- **🏠 home** - organization, maintenance, efficiency
- **👔 work** - processes, collaboration, project management
- **🔄 [habits](./habits/README.md)** - daily routines, behavior changes
- **⚡ automation** - scripts, workflows, systems

## 🌐 Language Support

Each TIO entry is documented in both English and Japanese:
- Main file: `YYYY-MM-DD-brief-description.md` (English)
- Japanese version: `YYYY-MM-DD-brief-description.ja.md` (日本語)

Both versions are cross-referenced for easy navigation between languages.

## 📋 Entry Format

Each TIO entry follows a consistent structure:

```markdown
# [Brief Title]

**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Category:** [category name]

## What I optimized
[Clear description of what was improved]

## How I did it
[Step-by-step explanation of the optimization]

## Impact
[What benefits this brings to life/work]

## Lessons learned
[Key takeaways or insights]
```

## 🎯 Philosophy

The goal is not to document major life changes, but to capture the small, incremental improvements that compound over time. Sometimes the smallest optimizations have the biggest impact on daily life and work efficiency.
