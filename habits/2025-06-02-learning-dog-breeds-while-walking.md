## What I optimized
Instead of just walking aimlessly during weekend walks, I decided to actively observe and learn the breeds of dogs I encounter. This transforms weekend exercise into an educational opportunity.

## How I did it
- During weekend walks, I pay attention to dogs I pass by
- Try to identify their breed based on their appearance, size, and characteristics
- Make mental notes of new breeds I encounter
- Look up unfamiliar breeds later to learn more about their traits and origins
- Gradually build knowledge of different dog breeds through weekend observations

## Impact
- Makes weekend walking time more engaging and purposeful
- Develops expertise in dog breed identification
- Adds an educational element to weekend exercise routine
- Increases awareness and observation skills during walks
- Creates a fun learning challenge that motivates weekend walking

## Lessons learned
- Simple additions to routine activities can make them more meaningful
- Learning can be integrated into any weekly habit
- Observation skills improve with practice and focused attention
- Small educational goals can enhance motivation for weekend activities
